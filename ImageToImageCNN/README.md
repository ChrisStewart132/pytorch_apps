## Introduction

This project implements an Image-to-Image Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the PyTorch framework. The model is designed to perform [**Describe the task your CNN does here, e.g., style transfer, image colorization, super-resolution, image segmentation, etc.**]. Image-to-image translation is a type of computer vision task that aims to transform an image from one domain to another. The network learns a mapping from an input image to an output image. The project demonstrates the training, testing and inference of this model.

[**Provide a few before and after image examples**]

## Model

[Drag and drop your model image here, or a diagram of your model architecture.]
The model is comprised of the following major parts:
* [**Describe the model architecture here. For example: The model follows an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections. The encoder portion of the network consists of n convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation function. The decoder portion mirrors the encoder and uses transposed convolutional layers. Add more detail as required.**]
* [**Describe the activation functions used here**]
* [**Describe the loss function used here**]

## Inference

Inference involves feeding an input image into the trained model. The model then processes this image and outputs a transformed image.
* [**Describe the pre-processing steps used here**]
* [**Describe the post-processing steps used here**]
* [**Describe any special considerations when running inference, for example: how long the inference took on different hardware**]
* [**Provide example inference code, or instructions on how to run the inference code**]

## Training

The model was trained using the [**Name of the dataset**] dataset. This dataset consists of [**Number**] of images. The dataset was split into the training and validation sets.
*   **Dataset:** [**More details about the dataset, e.g., image size, number of classes, etc.**]
